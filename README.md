## Implement.vim

Implement.vim is to replicate PHPStorm's auto generate abstract class and interface methods for the current php class.

The plugin is not fully completed yet but will be very shortly!  Check back for updates until the 1.0 release.

## Todo
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test to vspec that verifies full plugin behavior
- [ ] Make it work for abstract classes
